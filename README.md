## Note
This app is still in the development stage and is not an example of the final product!

## Description
An android application that allows users to set a study goal, score goal and an anticipated LSAT test date. They can then add the scores they have previously achieved in either practice or actual LSAT tests or edit the amount of study hours they have spent preparing for the test.

## Disclaimer
This is the first app I have ever tried to make on my own and as such, it is messy and should not be used as a perfect example of architecture or best practices.
